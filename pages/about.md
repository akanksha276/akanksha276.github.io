# **About Me**

Hi I am **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:,<br>
I leverage over three years of immersive experience in the AI industry. I recently completed my M.S in AI at San Jose State University and started working as a Machine Learning Engineer at Cisco. With a track record of authoring three research papers, winning hackathons, and achieving Kaggle Competition Expert status, I bring a unique blend of academic rigor and hands-on expertise. I specialize in constructing scalable end-to-end ML pipelines,  excelling in problem-solving across computer vision and NLP in diverse industries. I optimize models for performance, scalability, and real-time predictions.
